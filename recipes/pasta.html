  <p>With the cold weather
  upon us, it`s all about
  stayind in with your
  sweatpants and cooking up
  some major comfort food.
  Although I should mention
  it`s pushing 80 degrees F
  out here in Southern
  Califonia and I`m still
  walking around in shorts
  and flip flops.
  
  </p>
  <p>Still, that`s not
  stopping me from indulging
  in the ultimate kind of
  comfort food and throwing
  a shrimp and pasta party
  with Eat Shrimp and
  Calphalon. And wiht the
  help of Calphalon`s
  Comteporary Nonstick
  3.5qt. Pour and Strain pan
  and Stainless Utensils
  Silicone Tipped Tongs,
  this dish will come
  together in just 20
  minutes from start to
  finish.</p>
  <p>All you have to do is
  boil up some pasta and
  saute your shrimp in a
  pool of garlic-butter-herd
  goodness. Once that`s
  ready, just toss in your
  pasta and some fresh
  greens. That`s it. It`s
  easy, quick, and
  comforting in any kind of
  weather!</p>
