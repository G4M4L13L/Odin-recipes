  <h1>zucchini grrilled cheese</h1>  
  <p>A highly recommended way to be very
  unpopular with the people you share
  meals with is to tell them you`re
  making zucchini grilled cheese for
  dinner.</p>
  <p>"Like, zucchini as the bread?"</p>
  <p>"Zucchini instead of cheese?"</p>
  <p>"But i don`t like zucchini!"</p>

    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea or table salt, plus more if needed.</li>
    <li>1 cup (3 ounces or 85 grams) coarsely grated gruyere cheese.</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (2 1/2 ounces or 70 grams) coarsely grated fontina or provolone
      cheese.</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (20 grams) finely grated parmesan or pecorino cheese.</li>
    <li>fresly grround black pepper.</li>
    <li>8 htin slices bread of your choice, i used a country-style white bread.</li>
    <li>a couple tablespoons softened butter or olive oil for brushing bread.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>DIRECTIONS:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare zucchini: Use a food proccesor with a grater attachment or large
      holes of a box grater to grate the zucchini. In a large colander, toss
      together the zucchini and salt. Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes, until the
      zucchini has wilted and begun to relase liquid. Drain the zucchini in a
      colander and then use your hands to squeeze out as much water as possible, a
      fistful at a time. Place wrung-out zucchini on paper towels to drain
      further.</li><br>
    <li>Make filling and assemble sandwiches: Mix zucchini with grated cheese grated
    cheese, a lot of freshly gorund black pepper, and more salt if needed.</li>
    <p>Brush or spread the bread sides that will form the outsides of the sandwiches
    with olive or softened butter. Spread zucchini-cheeese on insides and close the
    sandwiches.</p>
    <li>Cook the sandwiches: Place sanwiches on a large griddle or frying pan over
      low-medium heat. I to cook grilled cheese slowly to give the centers a chance
    to really melt before the outsides get too brown. When the undersides are a
    deep golden brown, flip the sandwichies and cook until the color underneath
    matches the lid. cut sandwiches in half and dig in. Perhaps some pikled
    vegetable sanwich slaw on the side?</li>
